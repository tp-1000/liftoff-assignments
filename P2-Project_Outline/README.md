# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am always ready for a quick history lesson or story, and as I walk my neighborhood, I often find neighbors willing to indulge me. Over time, I have come to appreciate the way our physical environment can prompt us into sharing some detail of the past. I wanted a way to share these stories and thought pairing context with content could be one possible way.

This app lets a user tie content to a specific geographic point using latitude and longitude coordinates (GeoTagging). The GeoTag will be used when generating a map of regional content. Beyond the structure for posting and sharing there is little else in the application to dictate the nature of the content. People will be encouraged to share what they find interesting. I hope by seeing a broad collection of details (our content) we can get a glimpse of the much larger whole, the neighborhood.
